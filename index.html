                    <p class="Section2__article__p">My first exposure to <abbr title="Computer Science">CS</abbr> was in 8th grade computer class, where everything I had learned in previous years started to come together. Before that, I had done some coding for robotics class, mainly focusing on controlling hardware and automating simple tasks. However, this was the first time I experienced the true power of computer science: the ability to create software from scratch and bring my ideas to life. What stood out to me the most was the freedom I had to design and build something entirely my own, without limitations. The best part was being able to share my work with others so easily. By simply sharing a link, anyone could see my creation, and it felt empowering to know that the code I wrote could be experienced by people all over the world. The potential to share information and help inform others in this way was another aspect that drew me to the field. I was fascinated by how easily I could distribute knowledge, provide solutions, and inspire others with the projects I was working on. That moment in 8th grade marked the beginning of my passion for web development and the realization of how vast and impactful the world of computer science truly is.</p>

                        <h2 class="Section3__article__h2">PHP</h2>
                        <img class="Section3__article__img" src="Images/PHP.png" alt="">
                        <p class="Section3__article__p">I started using PHP when I realized that my websites needed to be more dynamic. At first, I was comfortable with HTML and CSS, but I quickly saw their limitations. While they allowed me to create visually appealing static pages, they couldn’t handle user interaction beyond simple links and forms. I wanted my websites to be more functional—able to process data, generate content dynamically, and provide a more interactive experience for users. That’s when I turned to PHP.</p>
                        <p class="Section3__article__p">PHP opened up a whole new world of possibilities for me. One of the first things I learned was how to process forms, allowing users to submit data that could be stored, retrieved, and displayed in meaningful ways. Soon after, I began working with databases, using MySQL to store and manage information efficiently. This meant I could build login systems, comment sections, and even small web applications that responded to user input. Seeing my code generate content on the fly and interact with databases in real time was exciting, and it pushed me to keep exploring more advanced features.</p>
                        <p class="Section3__article__p">As I became more comfortable with PHP, I started integrating it with JavaScript, creating even more powerful and dynamic websites. I experimented with user authentication, session management, and server-side validation, making my projects feel more polished and professional. Each new feature I implemented reinforced my understanding of backend development and how different technologies work together. Looking back, PHP was a turning point in my coding journey—it transformed my static pages into fully interactive experiences and deepened my passion for web development.</p>

                        <h2 class="Section3__article__h2">Servers</h2>
                        <img class="Section3__article__img" src="Images/mySQL.png" alt="">
                        <p class="Section3__article__p">Setting up and managing servers became an essential skill as I wanted to host my websites live. I started with local servers for testing, which helped me experiment with backend functionality without relying on external hosting. As I progressed, I set up a server on a Raspberry Pi, using it as a self-hosted environment to better understand how web servers operate. Installing Apache2 allowed me to serve web pages directly from the Pi, giving me hands-on experience with configuring a real server.</p>
                        <p class="Section3__article__p">Running a Raspberry Pi server wasn’t just about hosting websites—it also introduced me to crucial server management tasks. I learned how to set up and secure an Apache2 server, manage file permissions, and ensure everything ran smoothly. At the same time, I explored MySQL to handle databases, which added a whole new layer of functionality to my projects. By combining PHP with MySQL, I could store and retrieve user data dynamically, enabling login systems, contact forms, and interactive features.</p>
                        <p class="Section3__article__p">Working with my own server gave me a deeper understanding of networking, security, and performance optimization. I configured ports, managed SSH access, and ensured my sites were running efficiently. While working with the Raspberry Pi, I also learned how lightweight Linux-based systems handle web hosting, making me more comfortable with server administration. This hands-on experience made deploying websites feel more meaningful, as I wasn’t just coding the frontend—I was ensuring the entire system worked from the ground up.</p>

                        <h2 class="Section3__article__h2">JavaScript</h2>
                        <img class="Section3__article__img" src="Images/javascript.svg" alt="">
                        <p class="Section3__article__p">JavaScript came into play as I wanted to add interactivity and improve user experience. While HTML and CSS allowed me to structure and style my websites, they lacked the ability to make my pages dynamic. I started with simple scripts, using JavaScript to validate forms, toggle menus, and handle user input in real time. This immediately improved usability, ensuring that users received instant feedback without needing to reload the page.</p>
                        <p class="Section3__article__p">As I became more comfortable, I began using JavaScript to create engaging page elements like sliders, pop-ups, and animations. These enhancements made my websites feel more polished and interactive. I experimented with event listeners, manipulating the DOM to respond to user actions and dynamically updating content. This opened up a whole new world of possibilities, allowing me to craft experiences that felt fluid and responsive.</p>
                        <p class="Section3__article__p">To streamline development, I explored frameworks like jQuery, which simplified many repetitive tasks. jQuery’s concise syntax made it easier to manipulate elements, handle animations, and create AJAX requests with minimal code. As my projects grew in complexity, I started diving into modern JavaScript practices, learning about ES6+ features and asynchronous programming. JavaScript quickly became an essential tool in my development process, allowing me to bridge the gap between static design and fully interactive applications.</p>

The ability to add depth, movement, and realism to a website opens up so many creative possibilities, and I love how it enhances user engagement. Seeing 3D objects come to life on a webpage makes me excited to push my skills further and integrate more advanced graphics into my designs. As I continue learning, I look forward to using this technology to create immersive, visually dynamic experiences that go beyond traditional web design.</p>
